# binstream

Package ```binstream``` implements a flexible and lightweight binary stream with a clean and simple API
similar to [Go's bytes.Reader](https://pkg.go.dev/bytes#Reader).

The package serves as a great foundation for parsing binary file formats, it also gives complete control
to the user in a transparent API.
